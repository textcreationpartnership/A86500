         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> 
               <hi>People of the Earth.</hi> They ſeparated from the common ſort of people in <hi>habit,</hi> garments, or attire; contemning the brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the World, they attyred themſelves in ſuch a garbe as might have more ſhew of ſanctity (like them of old, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.4.) And this Sect of Phariſees were as ancient as diverſe hundred years afore Chriſt.) 'Twas their common phraſe (as R. <hi>Sophon</hi> teſtifies) to ſay, <hi>The garments of the people are the trampling of the Phariſees.</hi> And they ſeparated in their <hi>waſhings,</hi> and <hi>purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> to keep themſelves undefiled with worldly things, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.3, 4, 5. And in many other things they ſeparated from the common people. But that which is moſt pertinent to our purpoſe, is, they ſeparated from their company as much as poſſibly they could, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.39. like them of old, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.5. Come not neer. Hebrew, <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Touch me not,</hi> according to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117349:2"/>that of <hi>Luke</hi> 7.39. And the <hi>Publican</hi> ſtood <hi>afarr off,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Phariſee would not joyne in worſhip with him.</hi> So then, not to ſeparate at all, is to be behind a Phariſee; not to ſeparate more then a Phariſee, is not to obey Chriſt, <hi>that our righteouſneſſe ſhould exceed theirs;</hi> nor to obey the generall voice of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Revelation, Gen.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Caine went out from the</hi> PRESENCE <hi>of the</hi> LORD: that is, <hi>Caine</hi> was caſt out of the Church, otherwiſe Gods preſence is every where. And 'tis mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. as a moſt ſinfull mixture, that the <hi>Sons of God took to Wives the Daughters of men:</hi> And thus wee might goe on ſtep by ſtep thorough every book of the Bible; but the multitudes of buſineſſes command me to be briefe.</p>
            <p>In 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.53. <hi>Solomon</hi> urgeth it to God in prayer for a bleſſing on Iſrael, that <hi>they were a people ſeparated from all the people of the earth.</hi> In <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.11. they are commanded to <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themſelves from the people of the Land, as well as from their ſtrange Wives. Iſa.</hi> 52.11. the precept runs thus, <hi>Depart yee, depart yee, goe out from thence, touch no uncleane thing, goe yee out of the midſt of her, be yee cleane. Obſerve,</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That here is no expreſſion of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That the intimations of the Chapter extend it to a ſeparating from all Nations, as to a polluting mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</item>
                  <item>3. That tis expreſſe in the Text, that the deſigne of God is, that we ſo ſeparate as to keep our ſelves from pollution with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</item>
                  <item>4. That the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. doth extend this place further then to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> or to <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the like particular place.</item>
                  <item>5. That the Jewes were not now in Captivity.</item>
               </list>
This duty of ſeparation is commanded likewiſe in the New Teſtament, to all Chriſtians: In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. &amp;c. <hi>Be yee not unequally yoaked together with unbeleivers; for what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſſe with unrighteouſneſſe? And what communion hath light with darkneſſe; and what concord hath Chriſt with Belial? Or what part hath he that beleeveth with an Infidell? And what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? For yee are the Temple of the living God; as God hath ſayd, I will dwell in them, and walke in them, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come out from among them, and be yee ſeparate ſaith the Lord, and touch not the uncleane thing, and I will receive you, and I will be a Father unto you, and yee ſhall be my Sons and Daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty. Obſerve,</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That great famous men for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and piety, <hi>Eraſmus, Beza, Calvin, Piſcator, &amp;c.</hi> doe not thinke this to be reſtrained to <hi>Marriage</hi> (as ſome have dreamed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117349:3"/>by occaſion of the phraſe, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nequally yoaked</hi>) but of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or partnerſhip with men in ſpirituall pollution: Plainely the Apoſtles bidding them <hi>Come out from among them,</hi> cannot relate to Marriage once plighted. For he ſtates the queſtion contrary (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.12. &amp;c.) <hi>That the beleeving married perſon may dwell with the unbeleiving yoakefellow.</hi> And the Apoſtle levels his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation againſt all ſpirituall pollution; and particularly againſt <hi>Idols,</hi> and Heatheniſh <hi>Temples, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were neither <hi>Jewes,</hi> nor were they in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. That unleſſe we thus <hi>ſeparate,</hi> God will not be a <hi>Father to us, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
In <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.4. this duty of ſeparating is commanded to all Beleevers by a <hi>voice from Heaven. John</hi> ſaith, <hi>I heard a voice from Heaven, ſaying, Come out of her my people, that yee be not partakers of her ſins, that yee partake not of her plagues. Obſerve,</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That this is ſpoken to <hi>John</hi> a Jew, when the Jewes (properly ſo called) were not in <hi>Babylon</hi>) but in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> as doe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the Goſpell of <hi>John,</hi> and of the other Evangeliſts. And</item>
                  <item>2. tis ſpoken to all Gods people, in oppoſition to <hi>all Nations</hi> that had been polluted, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. And</item>
                  <item>3. that it is meant of all fellowſhip with ſuch as uſe a polluted worſhip, with enmity againſt purity. As Chriſt is ſayd to be <hi>crucified in the ſtreet of the great City, which is spiritually called</hi> SODOM <hi>and</hi> AEGYPT, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.8. Though crucified <hi>locally</hi> at Jeruſalem, yet ſpiritually in <hi>Aegipt</hi> and <hi>Sodom,</hi> becauſe thoſe names ſignifie filthy <hi>pollution,</hi> and <hi>enmity</hi> to purity. So <hi>Babylon</hi> is put to ſignifie the ſame in this 18. of <hi>Revel.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. And to come out from <hi>Babylon</hi> is by the ſame proportion to ſeparate from polluted worſhip, and worſhippers that hate, and to their power perſecute them that ſtand for purity. And that pollution, and thoſe kinds of men are elſewhere then in <hi>Babylon.</hi> You ſee then a ſeparation commanded. Thus we ought to Preach, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.19. <hi>If you take the precious from the vile, thou ſhalt be as my mouth.</hi> And thus ought yee to <hi>practice;</hi> elſe why doe you profeſſe purity and pretend to be Gods <hi>peculiar people</hi> (as <hi>Malachie</hi> 3.) Tis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therefore in that 15. of <hi>Jer.</hi> 19. <hi>Let them turne to thee, but doe not thou turne to them:</hi> If we Preach otherwiſe we are not Gods <hi>mouth.</hi> If you <hi>practice</hi> otherwiſe, you act not like Chriſts members, as we ſhall ſhew you preſently.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>From the generall of <hi>ſeparation,</hi> let us come to the particular intended. I ſhewed you before in another diſcourſe, that there is no ſhew or faire pretence can be held forth, that the Children of Parents, whereof neither can be judged to be a Beleever ought

            <p>This keeping out of graceleſſe people from the Communion, by the Officers and Brethren of a CHURCH is no new Doctrine, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but ancient; ſo that in the ſeverall ages of the Churches as they leſſe or more degenerated, we have more or leſſe print and footſtepps of this left us. The very <hi>Papiſts</hi> (who before the Councill of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſaith learned <hi>Polanus,</hi> was a true Church, though moſt impure) had their ſhrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, examinations, and confeſſions of people afore they were admitted to their Communions: The <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> way had it in forme of a Law in their <hi>Rubrick,</hi> for the Adminiſtration of the Communion, in theſe words, <hi>They that intended to partake of the holy Communion, ſhould ſignifie their names</hi> AFORE <hi>to the Curat; and if any of thoſe be an open, and notorious evill liver, ſo that the</hi> CONGREGATION <hi>is</hi> OFFENDED, <hi>or have done any wrong

And this is one of the great quarrels of theſe times, that particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Congregational way, as men think, are too preciſe in their admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; that they muſt be perſwaded there is ſome grace in a man, and that "all the Congregation preſent at his admiſſion muſt be ſatisfied, that there "is nothing to the contrary known to them, but that he hath grace. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to keep out thoſe from the Communion, of whom the contrary to true grace is known, may be eaſily granted, it being an evident truth of God.

Add according to all theſe places, that in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12, 13. The Church and its members, are ſayd to be WITHIN; all others are ſayd to be WITHOUT. Now conclude from all, as Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> doth in his caſes of conſcience, WITHIN, and WITHOUT, cannot be all one. If onely meet members, <hi>Saints,</hi> as the Apoſtle called them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1. be <hi>within,</hi> then thoſe that are not, ſuch
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117349:4"/>are to be <hi>without:</hi> Accordingly the Apoſtle ſhewes us in this ſame, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. That not onely <hi>Heathens,</hi> or <hi>odious debaucht</hi> men are <hi>without, v.</hi> 9. but a <hi>Brother</hi> walking diſorderly, is to be <hi>caſt</hi> OUT, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 5. And ſuch a one that continues ſo to walke to be <hi>kept out;</hi> and they to carry themſelves towards him as one <hi>without, v.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>More particularly, 1. In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2, 4, 6, 7, 8. tis ſaid. <hi>That the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians ſhould have mourned that the inceſtuous brother might have been taken away from among them.</hi> This the Apoſtles ſhews was their duty, and ſhould have been done, <hi>afore</hi> he needed to have ſent to them to doe it, becauſe they had neglected it. The Apoſtle goes on telling them that ſuch a one muſt be caſt out by them all. <hi>Purge out therefore the old leaven:</hi> likely that, <hi>Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to Satan,</hi> might be more immediately the Apoſtles ſentence: But the duty of all the Brethren, as well as of their Officer, or Officers, was to <hi>caſt him out, to take him away from among them, to purge him out,</hi> afore the Apoſtle ſent to them: For before he ſent to them, <hi>they all,</hi> the <hi>whole lump</hi> was <hi>leavened, ſoured, polluted,</hi> becauſe they had not done it; but had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to their <hi>feaſt,</hi> and ſtil now that the Apoſtle by their negligence is forced to take Cognizance of it; though as an Apoſtle, according to the juſt nature of that office, he calls upon this (as other Churches) to doe their duty, yet not the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> but the <hi>whole Church</hi> of the Officers and Brethren, even that whole lump that had been ſoured, muſt doe the deed of <hi>caſting that inceſtuous perſon out.</hi> And they are ſtill levened till they doe it: therefore the duty lay on all, elſe the ſin could not have layne on all. The Brethren ſhould have watch mens walkings, ſhould informe, ſhould proteſt, ſhould vote a diſorderly Brother out, though an Officer be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the meeting and debate, and to pronounce the ſentence. All the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren muſt have a hand in it (Women being forbidden to vote or prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34.) I ſay an hand in it to caſt our the ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous perſon, or the like offender, elſe the Apoſtle could not juſtly have charged the ſin upon all, without limitation. As their Women alſo might be guilty if they did not give information, and teſtimony, againſt ſuch a one in caſe they firſt knew of it. As the ſin of <hi>Achan</hi> (ſome others of neceſſity being privy to it, as circumſtances ſhew, and not teſtifying againſt him) is puniſhed on the whole Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whilſt he is unpuniſhed, and the whole Camp is threatned, now <hi>Achan</hi> is diſcovered, that <hi>God would not be with them,</hi> if they did not caſt him out; and therefore all in their ſeverall places, as farr as was needfull, were to act in it, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. So is it in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a Church againſt an offending member.</p>
            <p>From all, conclude theſe three rules,

                  <item>1. <hi>That</hi> which may <hi>caſt out,</hi> after admittance, may <hi>keep out</hi> afore admittance. But not onely <hi>greater</hi> ſins as here, but <hi>ſmaller ſins,</hi> as the World count ſmaller (we will name them by

                  <item>2. Rule, <hi>Thoſe</hi> that may caſt out after admiſſion, may keep out afore admiſſion; but the <hi>whole lump,</hi> all the Brethren of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as well as their Officer, are to caſt out, and any other might informe and give teſtimony; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all theſe are to be ſatisfied afore any one be received in, if they declare they are unſatisfied. <hi>Quod tangit omnes</hi> (ſaith the rule of equity) <hi>ab om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus faciendum.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. That which levens, ſoures, pollutes, a whole Church, doth <hi>mediately</hi> at leaſt, pollute ſuch a particular perſon as joynes to ſuch a polluted ſuch; yea <hi>immediately</hi> polluts ſuch a particular perſon that joyns in that act, that polluted that whol Church: Therfore a man or woman ought not to joyn to ſuch a Church as is polluted by keeping <hi>in it</hi> ſuch as walk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, much leſſe may a man or woman act with them in communicating with unworthily perſons, which is the very thing that (as the Apoſtle ſaith here) levens, ſoures, and pollutes the whole Church. If touching a leprous perſon, or dead body, in the ceremoniall Law, did pollute a Jew, and render him unmeet, for the preſent, to meddle with holy things; and to ſtand by the company that commit a fellony, or murther, not proteſting againſt it, doth by our Law make a man acceſſory; ſurely then there is more then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of guilt to ſuch a ſoule that ſhall co-act with a Congregation in mixt Communions, that, according to the Apoſtle, pollutes them all.</item>

That this buſineſs of avoyding ſpirituall polluting mixture, is of ſuch conſequence, that he <hi>writes twiſe about it,</hi> and that in two ſeveral Epiſtles, though the former of them be periſhed.

And there is the ſame reaſon proportionably in all unwar-ranted worſhip in matter or manner. 2. <hi>Covetouſneſſe,</hi> which is an heart, ſin, a ſpiritual mental ſin in the maine; <hi>extortion</hi> is the manifeſtation of it; and

Now if thoſe that are for mixt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions wil ſay that this is meant of <hi>ſpirituall eating</hi> the Lords ſupper with ſuch afore named; then they yeeld the queſtion of avoyding mixt Communions; that godly men muſt not receive the Lords ſupper with <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, railers, &amp;c.</hi> If they ſay it ſignifies <hi>civill eating</hi> of our common meales in our houſes; then they grant by neceſſary conſequence, that we may not eate at the Communion with ſuch inordinate perſons; for if it be a ſin to eate our common meat with evil livers, once <hi>called Brethren,</hi> then much more unlawful to eate at the Lords Table with them. Surely, ſurely, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle could not mean to be more careful to keep Saints more pure at their owne Tables then at the Lords Table.

He is now under an heavy judgement of God, which uſually more workes on the wicked, then ſingle Ordinances: therefore this Objection doth not ſuite with the point in hand. 3. Here is God making known to us, that the theefe repented at laſt; yea, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious words and confeſſions of the theefe of his ſin, and his juſtifying of Chriſt ſhew as much: But the dumb comming of a wicked man to the Communion, doth no more ſhew that he repents, then <hi>Judas</hi> his comming
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117349:7"/>to the laſt to Chriſts Sermons and Paſsover, did ſhew that he repented of his covetous and trayterous heart. 3. By this Objection we ſhould ſtil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a wicked man to repent at every Communion, though between Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions he lives wickedly all his life long; and ſo never any Church diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline ſhould be executed upon him, but Chriſts diſcipline be layd aſide and never uſed. 4. This of the theefe is but an <hi>example,</hi> which is an inartificial and inſufficient argument: and tis but one example of that kinde, from the beginning of the world, never the like to be again; as there was to be but one Chriſt, and to ſuffer but once on the Croſſe, and that once to ſhew his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in that his loweſt humiliation to forgive the theefe on the Croſſe. 5. But we have an evident rule to goe by, ſet down for us by Chriſt, how to deale with one that goes on in his ſins; and not for us to goe by gueſs, that when he comes to an Ordinance, a Communion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he then repents: The rule is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15. <hi>If thy brother ſhall treſpaſſe againſt thee, goe and tell him his fault between thee and him</hi> ALONE; <hi>if he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt</hi> GAI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NED THY BROTHER (ſee by this an <hi>hearing</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> and <hi>reforme</hi> is here meant) <hi>If he will not heare thee</hi> (Greek, to <hi>neglect what he heares) take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes, every word may be eſtabliſhed. And if he ſhall neglect to heare them</hi> (the ſame Greek word ſtill) <hi>tell it unto the Church: But if he neglect to heare the Church</hi> (the ſame Greek word) <hi>let him be unto thee an Heathen or Publican.</hi> See, a man that walkes diſorderly is not to be truſted (for ought this Text al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows) not <hi>one time</hi> after any one ſees his ſin, but that one Brother or Siſter muſt goe tel him of it <hi>alone,</hi> that ſo his ſinne may goe no further, nor the knowledge thereof, if he reforme. If not, the next time he is diſcovered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, two or three muſt joyne together to admoniſh him; and ſo to ſtop the ſin, and the diſgrace, if it may be, among them: If he goes on, then theſe two or three muſt complaine to the Church, or Congregation where he partakes of Ordinances: If he wil not be reformed at the admonition of the Church, then the Church, as tis a Church of Chriſt, can doe no leſſe then caſt him off as an Heathen: But if the Church ſhould be negligent to doe it, the pretence of ſaying, what <hi>can one member doe in this thing, and ſo of ſitting ſtill is eaſily removed;</hi> for if thou haſt managed thy buſineſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this rule, there are <hi>two or three</hi> of you to call upon the Church, and to quicken at leaſt, the better party in it, to prevaile with all the reſt to caſt him off. If all this will not doe it, thou haſt this to doe, namely, to call in for the adviſe of other Churches, as they did, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and until this be reformed, you have another remedy, namely, to withdraw Communion with ſuch a Church, as ſhal ſo groſly neglect their duty. For if, as in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6, 14. <hi>We muſt withdraw from every brother that walkes diſorderly;</hi> then ſure we have no warrant to communicate with a whole Church walking diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117349:8"/>where there is more ſin and ſinners, with ſin upon ſin; that offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſins, and their owne, in not puniſhing him, and diſobeying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, preſſed upon them by thoſe <hi>two or three;</hi> and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt hang over the heads of ſuch a Church, as over the Church of <hi>Pergamos,</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> for not proceeding againſt the <hi>Balaamites, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaitans,</hi> and <hi>Jezabelians:</hi> Yea, as over <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> for being cold in their zeale. Yet in the meane while, there is no neceſſity for you <hi>two or three</hi> that have thus juſtly withdrawn, for a time, to be without that precious Ordinance of the Communion, ſeeing other Churches, more pure, to whom you complaine, wil allow you that priviledge til things be ſetled. But it may be, ſome will ſay this rule is, <hi>If my brother treſpaſſe againſt me:</hi> but his treſpaſſe is not againſt <hi>me. Anſw. David</hi> tooke it to himſelfe, that the diſhonour that was done to God by men of evil life, was in ſome ſort againſt him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. And therefore he there lamented the ſin, and abhorred the practiſe. 2. If a Servant of your Family ſhould commit fornication, or drunkenneſſe with ſtrangers, not of the Family, you would ſoon charge it upon him or her, that they had offended againſt you, and all the Family. 3. If the offence doth not, or will not fall under the orderly admonition, firſt of one, then of two or three, ſo that thy brother goes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly on in his ſin in the generall obſervation of the Church; the Church without any more adoe, ſeeing his obſtinacy, may caſt him out; as 'twas the very caſe of the inceſtuous perſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Laſtly, we anſwer to this objection about the theefe on the Croſſe, That men that have been noted to walke diſorderly, ſhould firſt give proofe and experience of their <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> that they have <hi>confeſſed their ſins and forſaken them</hi> (as the Scripture ſpeakes) afore they ſhould be thought to repent, and be fit to come to the Communion; which we cannot righteouſly think they doe, who goe on in their old ſins, longer then they are at the Ordinances.

If he were onely at the Paſſover, it yeelds no argument for mixt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; for from a <hi>ceremoniall</hi> forme of worſhip of a <hi>Nationall</hi> Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> to an Evangelicall forme of worſhip of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> is no true plumb and level to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117349:8"/>pitch the due height of the purity of the worſhip under the Goſpel. We ſee evidently all along the old Teſtament, that if men were but ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly cleanſed, and not guilty of capital crimes, they were admitted to all Ordinances for the generall. But we ſee the New Teſtament rules are more exact about the partaking of the Lords Supper, as we have largely heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. 2. If <hi>Judas</hi> were at the Paſſover, and at the Communion alſo, afore he was openly diſcovered, it makes nothing for mixt Communions of ſuch as are openly known to walke wickedly, Chriſt now about to leave <hi>ſenſible</hi> rules of <hi>a viſible</hi> proceſſe, as might ſuit to his office, as he was a <hi>Mediator,</hi> would not now anticipate as a <hi>God</hi> and <hi>ſearcher</hi> of the heart, to keep out <hi>Judas</hi> from the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> becauſe <hi>he</hi> knew his <hi>heart</hi> was naught. This had been to have left us a pattern that would have been more againſt mixt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, then to keep out, and caſt out groſſe offenders; namely, to have ſo done by them, as ſoon as the Church had ſuſpected their hearts had not been right. 3. For certaine (if I doe not groſſy miſtake) <hi>Judas</hi> was not at the Lords Supper. 1. That which makes many miſtake that he was there, is the order of the ſtory of the Goſpel, as ſet downe by <hi>Luke, Chap.</hi> 22. Namely, becauſe firſt, there is mention of the <hi>Lords Supper, v.</hi> 20. Then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, followes the mention of <hi>Judas his hand at the Table, v.</hi> 21. And therefore as they thinke, <hi>Judas</hi> was at the Lords Supper: But we anſwer, that we have but the ſum of the hiſtory of the Goſpel; and the holy Ghoſt is not curious in obſerving the order of all things; and therefore the order is quite contrary in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. Namely, firſt there is mention of <hi>Judas his hand at the Table,</hi> that ſhould betray Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22, 23. And then after is the mention of the <hi>inſtitution of the Lords Supper;</hi> but no more mention of <hi>Judas</hi> till he came with the Officers to apprehend Chriſt. So, that ſame order is obſerved by <hi>Marke, Chap.</hi> 14. Firſt in <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19, 20. Is the <hi>Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of Judas,</hi> that he ſhould betray Chriſt: And then after, in <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>&amp;c. is mention of Chriſts inſtitution of the Lords Supper;</hi> and no more mention of <hi>Judas</hi> till he comes with the Officers, <hi>v.</hi> 43. to apprehend Chriſt. So that we have two to one, for this order, that <hi>Judas was diſcovered afore the Communion,</hi> and therefore <hi>Judas</hi> might well goe forth (according to Saint <hi>John, chap.</hi> 13.) afore the Communion. And therefore <hi>Luke</hi> did not intend to ſet down thoſe things, according to the accurate order of the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of things. Your moſt ancient mark in your Bibles, ¶ at <hi>v.</hi> 21. of that 22. of <hi>Luke,</hi> is uſed by the learned (afore we had any Verſes) to ſignifie a new matter, and that a diſtinct diſcourſe begins there. Namely, that when Chriſt did diſcover <hi>Iudas,</hi> he was at the Table with him (mark it, At the <hi>Table,</hi> tis not ſayd at the <hi>Communion</hi>) and with this begins the new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſtory of <hi>Iudas</hi> his betraying Chriſt. But is not a joynt ſtory (in order of doing) knit on to the end or concluſion of the Lords Supper; though
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117349:9"/>our Engliſh BUT, at 21. <hi>Verſe</hi> may ſeem to ſome to look that way. But in the Greek it is not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is, <hi>Truly,</hi> or <hi>moreover, &amp;c.</hi> which may well fit to begin a new diſtinct ſtory. And there is this further in that 22. of <hi>Luke,</hi> to prove, that <hi>Luke</hi> in that Chapter did not intend to ſet down things according to the order of <hi>doing,</hi> becauſe there is another diſtinct ſtory annext to that of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Supper, namely of the Diſciples contention about <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, v.</hi> 24. ſet down with that ¶ afore it, which <hi>Matthew</hi> in <hi>chap.</hi> 18. 1. and <hi>Mark</hi> in <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 34. ſet down long before Chriſts betraying by <hi>Iudas.</hi> Yea, further the Evangeliſts doe not regard acurateneſſe of <hi>order</hi> (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) in ſpeaking the ſame <hi>matter</hi> in one and the ſame Verſe. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as many cry, <hi>all</hi> men muſt be firſt taught before they are baptized, building on that order of words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>Goe teach and baptize;</hi> in <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. there is a contrary order, <hi>Iohn did baptize in the Wilderneſſe, and Preach:</hi> So that <hi>bare</hi> order of ſtory cannot yeeld any infallible argument that ſuch a thing was done then. 2. We affirme that for certaine (as farr as we can poſſibly ſee) <hi>Iudas</hi> was not at the Lords Supper, upon this argument out of <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. Chriſt and his Diſciples ate two Suppers afore the inſtitution of the Lords Supper. 1. The <hi>Paſſover</hi> Supper. 2. Their owne <hi>civill</hi> ſupper. 3. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Lords Supper. For in this we all agree (I think) that the Lords Supper was the laſt of all, according to all the Evangeliſts, that relate the inſtitution thereof. The firſt Supper, namely, the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> we have it, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> and <hi>ending, Iohn</hi> 13.1, 2. (turne to the place, elſe you will ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) This ſupper being ended, <hi>Chriſt riſeth from the Table, v.</hi> 4. <hi>layes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his Garments, takes a Towel, and water, and waſheth the Diſciples feet, v.</hi> 5. to the end of <hi>v.</hi> 11.

And <hi>v.</hi> 31. upon his going
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117349:9"/>out, Chriſt in a laudative manner ſaith, <hi>Now the Son of man is glorified, and God in him;</hi> and preſently fals to Preaching, and laſt to Praying in that high ſublime and tranſcendent ſpiritual manner, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. &amp; 14. &amp; 15. &amp; 16. &amp; 17. as never before, while <hi>Judas</hi> was with them. The Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> doth not mention the Lords Supper, which was the third and laſt, for reaſons beſt known to the holy Ghoſt. But doth moſt punctually tell us, <hi>Judas</hi> went out <hi>immediately</hi> after the Sop, which clearly was at their ſecond Supper, <hi>Viz.</hi> their common civil Supper. And therefore ſtayed not at the Lords Supper, which was laſt of all, according to the other Evangeliſts. For if <hi>Judas</hi> had ſtayd at the Lords Supper after his receiving the Sop, he had not according to the text, gone out <hi>immediately.</hi> But the text muſt be true: therefore <hi>Judas</hi> was not at the Lords Supper. If this argument be too long, I will give it you another way in a ſhorter manner: At the Lords Supper which was the laſt Supper, there was neither Sop nor Sauce; Chriſt mingled no ſuch thing, or Sippets in Wine, or, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we read of: But <hi>Judas</hi> went out immediately when he had received the Sop; for being then diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and filled with Satan, Chriſt, in effect, bid him be gone. Therefore <hi>Judas</hi> was not at the Lords Supper. I wil yet, if it may pleaſe, give it you a third way: <hi>John</hi> expreſly mentions that <hi>Judas</hi> was at the Paſſover, and the common Supper, but doth not ſay he was at the Lords Supper, not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the Lords Supper at all; and the other Evangeliſts, or Scriptures, doe not affirme <hi>Judas</hi> was at the Lords Supper; therefore wee have no ground to beleeve <hi>Judas</hi> was there.</p>

Though to come to the Lords Table, if it may be had according to Chriſts inſtitution, is an <hi>undoubted duty;</hi> yet it is not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117349:10"/>an undoubted duty that any ſhould come to take a ſin upon them, that they ſhould come to known mixt Communions, where other mens ſins, ſome how (as we have ſhewed) become theirs. 3. The <hi>company</hi> of unworthy perſons at the Communion is more then a <hi>circumſtance;</hi> for the contrary, namely, <hi>Saints meeting in faith and charity to partake of the Communion,</hi> is of the <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, i. e.</hi> of the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme</hi> of the Churches right receiving. But where there is a mixture of evil perſons, there is no ground of Scripture to <hi>beleeve</hi> I do doe wel; nor any vertuous object in ſuch unworthy perſons for me to <hi>love</hi> them, as fellow Communicants. 4. To except againſt unworthy perſons; and becauſe they are admitted, for me to forbear the Communion is not a <hi>miſtake;</hi> that cauſe is juſt, as we have ſhewed afore, and ſhal after. There is a miſtake at leaſt, or more by your own intimation in <hi>them that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving authority,</hi> doe not keep unworthy ones away; and <hi>in thoſe unworthy ones,</hi> that they keep not themſelves away. And if the former will bring a <hi>defilement</hi> on themſelves, and the latter wil bring <hi>judgement</hi> on themſelves, I cannot be excuſed if I may keep my ſelfe free from both, and will not. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of <hi>Pariſhes</hi> in <hi>England</hi> were made by <hi>Pope Honorious,</hi> about 1200. years ſince, and ſo of no divine inſtitution, nor inforce any divine obligation for me to receive only in mine own Pariſh. The Scriptures ſend me to a <hi>true Church,</hi> not to a <hi>Pariſh.</hi> If one Church be polluted, and there is another not farr off that is free, from that known pollution; in ordinary prudence one would chooſe pure things afore polluted. Its a ſtated caſe in Caſuiſts, as in Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> caſes of conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that a man may goe from a pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Church to a pure Church: and yet here is no danger in ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon of ſeparation upon ſeparation, as you after object, if Churches will doe their duty. If a Church wil ſeparate from the rule of the Word, what would your conſcience troubled at it, doe, in ſuch a caſe? Would you againſt conſcience offend and tranſgreſſe with the reſt. For fifthly, If a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about religious things be againſt my conſcience, though by miſtaking; the godly Caſuiſts reſolve, that till I be informed, I ſhal ſin againſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to doe it. So Doctor <hi>Ames,</hi> and ſtudy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.22. Yea ſo Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 14.23. whatſoever is <hi>not of faith is ſin:</hi> For the Apoſtle ſpeaks of things indifferent, and ſo of matters that I might have done, and 'twas my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that I was not perſwaded I might have done them; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts Brethren not to eate any thing <hi>to the offence of a weak Brother, Rom.</hi> 14.20, 21. although tis his weaknes to <hi>take offence about kinds of meats.</hi> And therefore, ſixthly, we ſay, why doe not Churches that uſe mixt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions more tender the conſciences of them that cannot bear theſe mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? They keeping out the unworthy would prevent all this adoe. Save your words, and Paper and Ink, in writing in behalfe of mixt Communions, what need we plead for rubbiſh? We cannot be too pure in our practiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117349:10"/>to the Scriptures. If the Church and Officers be they, whom you meane, have <hi>authority to keep out unworthy ones from the Communion</hi> (ſo had the Church of Corinth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. And I know none elſe but the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, by joynt conſent have the immediate proper power) why do not they doe their duty? Why muſt there ſuch load be layd upon a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular tender conſcience, that out of conſcience doth abſtaine from a mixt Communion; whiles the whole congregation goe on in their ſin of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſinful mixtures and ſuppoſe againſt conſcience, and againſt admonition. For ſure no Miniſter and People more or leſs in any congregation, but could wiſh, that unworthy perſons were kept out. And the caſe here, as before touched, is not onely of <hi>one private perſon,</hi> as private. For we put the caſe as men according to rule ought to act (in caſe they were ſo imprudent as to incorporate to a congregation that ſhunned not ſuch mixtures) a godly man ſees a neighbour that came to the Communion tranſgreſſe, <hi>he admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him of it, &amp;c.</hi> according to <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15. The matter at laſt by theſe two or three Brethren <hi>is brought afore the Church.</hi> Here is more then <hi>one.</hi> And in the Church they act as <hi>publick perſons,</hi> fellow members. As three Juſtices on the Bench are publike perſons, though there be twenty more there. If theſe three brethren, with ſome other that no doubt will adhere to the rule, cannot prevaile againſt the Officers or major vote, to caſt out the unworthy; a withdrawing from ſuch a congregation is not upon ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate a conſideration: Yea, the matter is of ſo publike a concernment, that other Churches muſt blame that Church (if they reforme not) and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſuch as withdraw, according to rule (in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6, 14.) becauſe they cannot attaine the end of that rule, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15. Sure if we muſt withdraw from any <hi>one</hi> Brother, walking diſorderly contrary to rule, as tis in that 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6, 14. then much more from <hi>a whole Congregation of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> walking contrary to rule, and ſo offending <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>conſciences</hi> of his Lambs. The deſign then is not ſeparation upon ſeparation, but to keep Churches to the rule. But to ſpeak al in a word, Pariſh congregations, for the moſt part as in relation to the communion, have ſo il a <hi>conſtitution,</hi> that they cannot tel where to begin to reform; and then they muſt defend it, ſeeing they cannot amend it; and ſo <hi>break Chriſts Commandements, and teach men ſo,</hi> But if it be <hi>ſeparation upon ſeparation,</hi> or a taking <hi>Churches out of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> tis a thing, I think, not contrary to all rule, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. to end, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.14. (explained afore) and the beſt Saints generally in all ages have practiſed, and they alſo (I mean the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>) that cry out againſt it. There was a true <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and particular Jewiſh Synagogue-congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, among which Chriſt Preached, for three yeares and an half; yet, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and thence forward out of them was a <hi>ſeparation,</hi> and a <hi>gathering of Chriſtian Churches:</hi> Therefore ſimply and <hi>abſolutely,</hi> to go from Church
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117349:11"/>to Church, or <hi>gather Churches out of Churches</hi> is not unlawfull. Again, the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> was a true Church, as famous <hi>Polanus</hi> proves (though a moſt polluted one) it was eſſentially a true Church, till in the Councill of <hi>Trent</hi> they pronounced an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt all the maine truths of Chriſt, and ſo gave him <hi>a bill of divorce,</hi> yet juſtly when <hi>Luther</hi> Preached more light, and holineſſe, many Nations, and among them anon <hi>England</hi> did alſo ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from them, and their congregations departed from them in Doctrine in part, and in forme of worſhip. Many corruptions remaining among the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> partly in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> namely that of <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> and partly <hi>in ceremonies;</hi> many Chriſtians gathered themſelves into purer Churches at <hi>Geneva, &amp;c.</hi> And here in <hi>England</hi> of late, the <hi>Presbyterian Churches</hi> were a little refined in ſome things out from the Epiſcopal congregations. So then to tell me there muſt not be <hi>ſeparation upon ſeparation;</hi> and that if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>diſcerne</hi> not the Lords body, <hi>yet I doe;</hi> and if another hath <hi>no right</hi> to it, yet <hi>I have, &amp;c.</hi> theſe are all contrary, as well to former practice, as well as <hi>rule,</hi> and are impertinent to our point in hand. <hi>Churches</hi> that will be <hi>called</hi> and <hi>counted</hi> Churches, muſt be <hi>conſtituted</hi> as Churches, and <hi>act</hi> as Churches: they muſt be <hi>godly perſons, joyning together, and ſetling their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers among them, with one unanimous conſent to keep out unworthy perſons; and upon due complaint and proceeding, as aforeſaid, to caſt out unworthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> So the diſpute is at an end. Conſciences ſhal not be troubled. No dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſeparation. Good mens conſciences ſhall be cheriſhed, and bad men ſhall be ſhamed till they repent; the dogs ſhall not have opportunity to ſnatch the childrens bread, nor the children afrayd to goe to their meals, leſt if they let not the dogs take ſhare with them, they <hi>bite and teare them.</hi> Is he a wiſe governour of a Family that will ſay, <q>Children, Servants, goe to dinner, let the Dogs alone to ſhare with you, though they take of your meat, doe you take your meale?</q> When he may far eaſier, by help of his Family, ſhut the Dogs out, if they be ſo unruly: And tis at leaſt as unwiſe an exhortation to ſtir up godly men to goe to mixt Communions, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them to goe thither, when tis known that there are many there that have Plague-ſores upon them: Sure ſpirituall infection is worſe then cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and the ſoule more precious then the body.</p>

            <p>To which we <hi>duply,</hi> and anſwer thus, to both places diſtinctly. 1. To that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117349:11"/>of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. tis evident that the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the <hi>paſt time,</hi> of things <hi>paſt</hi> (not of what in future, that evill example might effect, but of an evill paſt) that 'twas <hi>their</hi> ſin, <hi>all the churches</hi> ſin, that they had not been <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for letting ſuch a one</hi> abide a member amongſt them, <hi>v.</hi> 2. Secondly, That he ſpeaks in the <hi>Preſent tence</hi> of their preſent condition, that the whol lump of them was now at preſent <hi>levened</hi> by that perſon being one of them; though they were <hi>unlevened in their</hi> perſons, in regard of regeneration, or elſe they could not be ſayd to be <hi>levened,</hi> but rather to be <hi>very leven;</hi> yet le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened in their actions in regard of polluting mixture, and polluted worſhip. 3. For <hi>future,</hi> 1. The Apoſtle cold not imagin that by example <hi>all the church of</hi> Corinth could become <hi>inceſtuous</hi> perſons; but <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>danger of the levening the whole lump.</hi> 2. He ſpeaks of keeping the <hi>feaſt purely;</hi> and of <hi>not eating with a Brother walking diſorderly:</hi> Therefore from all its plain the Apoſtle drives at more then <hi>evill example;</hi> namely, at evil of <hi>Church-communion</hi> with unworthy perſons; ſo likewiſe to the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. place, <hi>Viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. we ſay that as there is a Anti-federall unholineſſe or <hi>uncleanneſſe</hi> in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren whoſe Parents neither of them are beleevers, though theſe children may be elect, and in time may beleive, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14, And a <hi>matrimonial-like,</hi> or a <hi>tanquam conjugal union</hi> between an Harlot and a Chriſtian, whiles that Chriſtian by temptation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fals into that <hi>ditch</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, of which union, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15.16, 18. So there is a <hi>confederate</hi> oneneſſe unto ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pollution, or purity, according to the matter and manner of worſhip men joyne in. If in the due partaking of the Lords Supper; tis the Communion of the body and blood of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. If in eating and drinking at the Idolatrous feaſts, they that did ſo, though <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> are ſaid to <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the cup</hi> of Devils, <hi>v.</hi> 20. And by the ſame proportion, a compound of good and evil, doth make the partners in the ſame to ſhare in that evill mixture; as we have heard much afore. 2.

               </q> With many the like holineſſe-depreſſing <hi>doctrines;</hi> and ſuitably (as needs muſt) the people <hi>practice.</hi> Thus, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. <hi>v. ult. The Prophets propheſie falſely, and the Prieſts bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it ſo, and what will yee doe in the end thereof?</hi> Thus in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>There were falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> among the people, as there ſhall <hi>be falſe Teachers among you, &amp;c.</hi> How
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:117349:13"/>ſhall we know them? By their laying <hi>holineſſe</hi> low, <hi>deſpiſing, or bringing into contempt Chriſt,</hi> making <hi>the way of truth evil ſpoken of;</hi> through <hi>covetouſnes making merchandiſe of mens ſoules or ſalvation;</hi> leading or leaving people in their <hi>riotings and wantonneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> throughout the Chapter. The Apoſtle teacheth us better, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>v. ult.</hi> covet earneſtly the <hi>beſt</hi> gifts, and I will ſhew you a <hi>more excellent</hi> way: and chargeth us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.10. as we wil ſhew our ſelves to be <hi>ſyncere,</hi> to approve the <hi>things that are excellent,</hi> and to be without offence. So that if it were <hi>lawful</hi> to have ſom unworthy at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but it were <hi>beſt,</hi> or <hi>more excellent</hi> to have none, we ſhould chooſe the <hi>beſt</hi> way, and that which is <hi>moſt excellent.</hi> You ſee, notwithſtanding all objections, that this truth ſtands firm; <hi>that perſons known to walk unworthily, and unbeſeeming an ordinary true Chriſtian,</hi> ſhould not be admitted to the Lords Supper, <hi>nor ſhould true Chriſtians communicate with ſuch unworthy ones, in caſe others will admit them.</hi> And the trut<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is, to ſpeak my conſcience, therefore <hi>ordinary</hi> partakers of mixt Communions are ſo little <hi>reformed,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church-rules (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6, &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.) are ſo negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and in ſtead thereof, graceleſſe men are nuzled up in a ſelf-flattery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe admitted to the priviledges of the beſt Saints: and the <hi>beſt</hi> that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of ſuch mixt communions are not ſo <hi>quickned and comforted,</hi> becauſe polluted Ordinances are not ſo bleſt to men, that by neglect of rule pollute them. Study that place, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.26.28.31. and that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.3, 6.</p>

               <hi>Qu.</hi> How ſhould a Congregation know what a Communicant is? <hi>Anſ.</hi> By conference, by enquiry, by converſation: In other things men would be inquiſitive, by thoſe means to know exactly, as in matters of Marriage, ſervants, Partnerſhip, <hi>&amp;c.

If any ſuch break out and appeare worſe then they were, they are to be caſt out, if not reformed, according to rule. * But thoſe aſſemblies that take in among them thoſe that are apparently bad at firſt; they cannot with any ſhew of Juſtice, according to their principles caſt out <hi>ſuch,</hi> whiles <hi>ſuch,</hi> becauſe they are as good at laſt as at firſt, <hi>Viz.</hi> naught all along.</item>
                  <item>4. In careleſſe Congregations receiving all to the Communion, men come in openly bad, becauſe no ſtop is made, and ſo continue, becauſe no orderly admonition is exerciſed: but in Congregations that are exact, to look well to the <hi>Gates</hi> of the Church, and yet ſome make the Church beleeve they are right, becauſe they pronounce <hi>Shibboleth</hi> right, I meane they make a laudable confeſſion, and are unblamable in their converſation, and ſo creep in, and at laſt appear to be naught, it is the ſin of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> not of the <hi>receivers;</hi> and they lye open to the Law of Churches to be thrown out, becauſe growne worſe: And uſually unſound hearted Profeſſors doe grow worſe, for this reaſon, becauſe Phariſaically they truſted in their relation and memberſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Lay all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and conſider whether the way we have propounded, or the way of mixt Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe moſt tend to purity and reformation which we profeſſe, and pretend, in oppoſition to former corrupt times.
